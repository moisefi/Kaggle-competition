# Kaggle-competition
Proyecto realizado para una competición de la plataforma Kaggle. Predicción de precios de casas usando sklearn y los datasets proporcionados por kaggle.


1- You will need Jupyter notebook. If you have anaconda you can find it there, otherwise you will have to download it

2- Download Files

3- Read the data_description.csv file to understand what data we are going to work with

4- We have an example of what we need to get as a result in sample_submission.csv

5- The files train.csv and test.csv contain the data that we are going to use to make the prediction

6- Open HousePrices.ipynb

7- Run the code (if it doesn't work check that all the files are in the same folder)

8- Explore the results, you will have two new files submission.csv and submission2.csv, two results of two different predictions.
